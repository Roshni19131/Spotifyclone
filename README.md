🎵 Spotify Clone
A Spotify Web Player Clone built completely with HTML and CSS.
This project is a static front-end replica of Spotify’s interface, designed to mimic its clean and modern layout. The goal of this project is to practice front-end web development fundamentals, focusing on structuring a webpage using semantic HTML and styling it with advanced CSS concepts like Flexbox, Grid, and responsive design.

🔍 Overview
This project recreates the look and feel of Spotify’s desktop version.
The layout includes a sidebar navigation, a main content area for playlists and songs, and a footer music player.
It is a static website (no JavaScript or backend) — intended purely for design and front-end practice.

✨ Features
🎶 Spotify-inspired user interface.
📱 Responsive design for desktops, tablets, and mobile screens.
🎨 Modern CSS-only styling with Flexbox and Grid.
🖼️ Navigation bar, playlist section, and footer music player.
⚡ Lightweight and fast – no external libraries, just pure HTML & CSS.

🚀 Tech Stack
HTML5 – semantic structure of the application.
CSS3 – styling, responsiveness, and layout.

🎯 Learning Outcomes
By building this project, I practiced and strengthened:
✅ Structuring webpages with semantic HTML5.
✅ Using Flexbox and Grid for layout design.
✅ Creating responsive websites with media queries.
✅ Applying modern UI/UX design principles.
✅ Organizing files and folders for front-end projects.

🔮 Future Improvements
While this version is static, here are potential improvements for the future:
🎧 Add JavaScript for interactive features (play, pause, progress bar).
🌐 Integrate the Spotify Web API for real data.
🌓 Implement dark/light themes toggle.
🎵 Add actual audio playback functionality.
